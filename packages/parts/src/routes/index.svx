# House Visual Study Bible Kitbook

Documentation and Prototyping

We are currently in the process of adding content to the New Testament, after which will come the Old Testament. After completely publishing study resources for the whole Bible, regular updates will continue to provide the latest biblical scholarship and additional articles and images.

This kitbook will serve both the general public with more in-depth information about the HVSB for those who are interested, as well it will serve the development process by making prototyping and documenation easy.
