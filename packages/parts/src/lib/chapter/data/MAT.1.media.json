(John 1:1; Matt 5:37; Mark 4:19; Luke 4:22; John 2:22; Acts 4:31; Rom 9:6; Heb 7:28; 1 Jn 5:7, Rev 9:19) Strong’s 3056</p><p>This is the word from which we get our English word “logic,” but to read that meaning from English back into the first century use of this Greek word would be anachronistic and inappropriate. This word,&nbsp;λόγος (<i>logos</i>), is used over three hundred times in the NT. In one category of uses, it is refers to 1) an expression of the mind, 2) a statement or discussion, 3) a “word,” or a matter or thing under discussion and 4) extending of the previous meaning, simply a “thing.” In another category, it is used for a “mathematical computation,” “reckoning” or “settlement of an account.” Finally, it is used for the second person of the Trinity as the “expression” or “revelation” of God. Jesus is by choice and destiny Savior; He is by nature the revelation of God. In the progress of revelation from Job and Genesis forward, the “Word,” the incarnate Jesus, is the best and most complete revelation of God to date. The next progression or improvement in revelation will be at the revelation of Jesus Christ when He comes again. In John 1, the apostle does not specifically identify that the subject of His writing is Jesus until 1:17. John refers to his subject at first only as the word, then creator, then light, then the one who came, then the word become flesh, then finally as Jesus Christ. Most foundationally, the “Word” is the second person of the Trinity. He is the express revelation of God in the most personal and intimate way, since He reveals God, while being God. John’s grammar in 1:1 asserts first the eternality of the Word (at the beginning [of time and creation], the Word already was), secondly the interrelatedness of the first and second persons of the trinity (the Word was in a face-to-face relationship with God) and thirdly the divinity of the “Word” (and the Word was divine). The Word is Jesus, the personal expression of divinity, God’s best revelation yet.</p>",

Jesus’ use of the term here is very interesting. It seems to redirect the readers’ thinking away from making earthly values primary, toward making heaven’s values primary. Jesus’ teaching seems to recall Ecclesiastes, which teaches that life under the sun is vain until heaven’s reality is brought to bear. It may also have given root to Paul’s teaching in passages such as Rom 12:1, 2 and 2 Cor 4:17, that believers must approach life from a heavenly, divine perspective. So, when Jesus uses this term here He is challenging His hearers to see that true happiness finds root in heaven’s values and reward, and thus it is a privilege, a blessing, to suffer temporarily for such great, eternal gain.</p>",

These events are arguably some of the most splendid and glorious in history, and some of the most honoring to Jesus and His Father. God’s eternal and ultimate purpose is to glorify Himself. God’s highest purpose for a human being, His image, is that he or she glorify Him. In both Testaments, the glory of God is understood as a tangible, physical reflection of God’s intangible, invisible attributes (nature). To glorify God is to give tangible expression to His intangible nature and personality.

The word fulfill means “to fill out, expand, or complete.” It does not mean to bring to an end. Jesus fulfills the law in several ways: (1) He obeyed it perfectly and taught its correct meaning (vv. 19 , 20 ); (2) He will one day fulfill all of the OT types and prophecies; and (3) He provides a way of salvation that meets all the requirements of the law ( Rom. 3:21 , 31 ). one jot or one tittle will by no means pass: This statement of Jesus provides us with one of the strongest affirmations in the Bible of the inerrancy of Scripture.

The essence of this sermon was probably preached many times during Jesus’ early ministry. The Sermon on the Mount was not given as the way of salvation for the lost, but as the way of life for true children of the kingdom. It was instruction for those who had responded to Jesus’ invitation to “repent” ( 4:17 ). These disciples were probably confused as to the true nature of righteousness and God’s kingdom. In this address, Jesus clarified both the heart of the law and the nature of true religion in God’s kingdom (see Mic. 6:8 ). In a sense, Jesus turned the law, which was mainly negative, inside out to show its positive core (v. 17 ).</p><p>Nelson, Thomas. NKJV, The NKJV Study Bible, eBook (Kindle Locations 257432-257440).

Strong's 1653</p><p>The verb ἐλεέω (eleeo) “to have mercy” has a cognate noun formed from the same root in Greek, ἔλεος (eleos), “mercy,” which occurs about as often in the NT. Both mean to show compassion and concern, even pity, for someone in need. To show mercy in some circumstances is not to give to someone what they do deserve. In Luke 18:39, a blind man asks the “Son of David,” a messianic title, for mercy, then Jesus restores his sight. Human beings are exhorted to show mercy, and in fact the gift of mercy is one of the spiritual gifts. Human mercy is a reflection of divine mercy. God’s mercy is literally the salvation of humanity, both in terms of eternal redemption, as well as temporal blessing and the sustaining of life. For these reasons, mercy is a very important theological and spiritual term, helping to define our salvation, human nature and the need for humility.</p>"

        "text": "<p>Most Christians throughout history have believed that marriage was intended for one man and one woman for as long as they both live. They have further believed that, with one exception, adultery is committed by a person who divorces his or her spouse and marries another. The question is, what is meant by&nbsp;πορνείᾳ” (<i>porneia</i>—“except for immorality”); three possibilities have generally been given.&nbsp;</p><p>If the word <i>immorality&nbsp;</i>was used in its more restrictive sense, possibly referring to an illegal marriage under Jewish Law (see Lev 18:6-18; Matt 14:1-3), or the unfaithfulness of a Jewish bride during her betrothal (see Deut 22:13ff; Matt 1:18-19), then there are no biblical grounds for divorce and remarriage for those in a fully consummated, biblically legal marriage. This has been the historical view of the Church Fathers and the Roman Catholic Church.&nbsp;</p><p>If, on the other hand, the word that is translated <i>immorality&nbsp;</i>was used in the sense of sexual sin, including marital infidelity, then there are biblical grounds for divorce. In such cases, the innocent partner is free to remarry without committing adultery because the original marriage was nullified by the guilty partner's sexual misconduct (see Deut 24:1-4; Matt 19:1-10). This has been the majority view held by the Reformers and evangelicals.</p><p>Others have argued that &nbsp;Jesus did not discuss other <i>biblical</i> grounds for divorce, such as neglect (Exod 21:10-11), but He did not disapprove of divorce on these grounds. This position sees Jesus answering a very specific question, relating to a debate that had begun between the Hillel and Shammaite rabbinic schools over divorce. In the early years of the first century A.D., the Hillel school began to issue divorce certificates for “any matter,” while the Shammaites argued that divorces were only allowed for “matters of indecency” (which included sexual sin, as well as neglect). Jesus seems to have sided with the Shammaites, since He used almost the exact same phrase. This argument would also negate the seeming contradiction between Jesus on Paul on the subject (1 Cor 7:15).&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on the first two views, see <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divorce-Remarriage-Christian-Spectrum-Multiview/dp/0830812830/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=H.+Wayne+House%2C+Divorce+and+Remarriage%2C+Four+Christian+Views&amp;qid=1614888852&amp;sr=8-1\">H.

Additionally, Old Testament texts teach the same principle that Jesus gave in his Sermon on the Mount (Exod 23:4, 5; Prov 24:17, 18 and Leviticus 19:18; Job alludes to this idea, as well, in Job 31:29-30).

Charles, \"In Ahiqar, Syriac A version, we read (2:20), \"My son, if your enemy meet you with evil, meet him with wisdom\" (R. H. Charles, <i>Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha</i>, 11, 730).

The nature of the sexual bond argues for the foolishness of promiscuity, doing damage to the marital bond or to one’s ability to successfully make that bond in the future.
