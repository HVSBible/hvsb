<p><strong>I FIGURED IT OUT. IF YOU PUT A COLON AFTER A VERSE REFERENCE IT DOUBLES THE TEXT. I TYPED A COMPLETE COPY AND EXPLORED A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND IT CAME OUT RIGHT IN THE FILE: THE ADORNING OF THE LAMB'S BRIDE</strong></p><p>The Lamb (Jesus) is glorified by the multitude because the wife of Jesus (the church) had prepared for the wedding. The bride's garment of \"bright, pure, and fine linen\" represents the righteous acts of the saints (Eph 5:23, 32). The practice of the Middle East in these times:</p><blockquote><p>\"The adorning of <u>the bride</u> was a very costly and elaborate affair. Much time was given to the preparation of her person. Every effort was put forth to make her complexion glossy and shining with a luster like unto marble. The words of David must have been their ideal for her: “that our daugh­ters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace.” Psa. 144:12. Her dark locks of hair were often braided with gold and pearls. She was decked with all the precious stones and jewels that the family had inherited from previous generations. Those who were too poor to afford much would borrow what they could from their friends.\"[1] Fred H. Wight, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Manners-Customs-Bible-Lands-Wight/dp/0802451756\">Manners and Customs of Bible Lands</a>, 130-131.</p></blockquote><p>This Middle Eastern custom is referenced in Jer 2:32: \"Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire?\" and the words of the apostle John when he saw the New Jerusalem come down from God out of heaven in the new heavens and new earth, saying that the city was \"prepared as a bride adorned for her husband\" (Rev 21:2).</p>
